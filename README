These are my personal configuration files. If you think they're good, feel free
to use them and/or send improvements, otherwise just leave them alone.

I'm not giving any warranties of any kind for them to work - read the code,
and if you don't understand it, dont execute it.

If you type "make", the Makefile will install symlinks to the checked-out
repository, for example
~/.gvimrc -> /home/blahfoo/git/config-files/home_dot_gvimrc
