# iptables-L - my most used iptables alias.
#
# just type it whenever you'd type "iptables -L" normally.
#
# it numbers the lines, so iptables options -I n (insert before n),
# -R n (replace n) and -D n (delete n) are easy to use.
#
# Also it uses -n, to avoid dns lookups
#
exec /sbin/iptables -v -n --line-numbers -L "$@"
