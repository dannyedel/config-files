# search a git-tree for files not conforming to the standard

#  * only basic alphanumerics 0-9 a-z A-Z
#  * dot, minus and underscore okay as word separator

# Note: It will not find filenames containing a slash, but I think
# it would be near-impossible to inject these into a git tree
# in the first place.
#
# Note: If a directory contains a bad character, every filename
# in that directory will be output.
